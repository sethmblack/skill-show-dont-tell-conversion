# Show Don't Tell Conversion

Convert abstract statements, descriptions, and "telling" into concrete scenes, dialogue, and dramatization. Based on Twain's principle: "Don't say the old lady screamed. Bring her on and let her scream."

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Show, don't tell" or "Make this come alive"
- Prose describes emotions, events, or characters rather than dramatizing them
- Content tells readers what to think instead of letting them experience it
- Story or pitch feels flat and abstract
- Need to make writing more immersive and engaging

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| content | Yes | Prose that tells rather than shows |
| context | No | The broader piece this fits into |
| constraints | No | Word count or format limitations |

## The Telling-to-Showing Spectrum

### Pure Telling (Avoid)
"John was angry."

### Telling with Details (Better)
"John was angry because his project had been cancelled."

### Showing through Action (Good)
"John slammed the report on his desk."

### Showing through Scene (Best)
"John's jaw tightened. He read the email twice, then slammed his laptop shut. 'Three months,' he said to no one. 'Three months of my life.'"

---

## The Conversion Process

### Step 1: Identify the Telling

Look for these patterns:
- **Emotion labels:** "She was sad/happy/angry/nervous"
- **Character summaries:** "He was a kind man" / "She was intelligent"
- **Event summaries:** "The meeting went badly" / "They had a fight"
- **Judgment statements:** "It was a beautiful day" / "The speech was inspiring"
- **Reader instructions:** "This was important because..." / "The reader should understand..."

### Step 2: Ask the Key Question

For each "telling" passage, ask: **What would I see if I were there?**

- If they're angry, what are they DOING?
- If the meeting went badly, what HAPPENED?
- If she's intelligent, how does that SHOW in her actions?
- If it was beautiful, what SPECIFICALLY made it so?

### Step 3: Choose Your Showing Method

**Action:** What the character DOES
- "She was nervous" → "She checked her phone for the third time in two minutes"

**Dialogue:** What the character SAYS
- "He was dismissive" → "'Sure, whatever you think,' he said, not looking up from his screen"

**Sensory Detail:** What we SEE, HEAR, FEEL
- "The room was oppressive" → "The fluorescent light hummed. The air tasted recycled."

**Specific Detail:** Concrete over abstract
- "She was wealthy" → "She wore her grandmother's diamonds like they were costume jewelry"

**Contrast:** Show through what's unexpected
- "He was tired" → "He'd stopped dreaming weeks ago"

### Step 4: Write the Scene

Transform the telling into a moment the reader experiences:
- Use present-tense verbs for immediacy
- Include at least one sensory detail
- Let dialogue reveal character
- End on the strongest image

### Step 5: Test the Conversion

Ask:
- Can the reader SEE this?
- Does this PROVE the claim rather than assert it?
- Would this work in a movie?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Show Don't Tell Conversion

### Original (Telling)
[The passage that tells]

### What It's Trying to Convey
[The underlying meaning or emotion]

### Showing Method Used
[Action / Dialogue / Sensory Detail / Specific Detail / Contrast]

### Converted (Showing)
[The dramatized version]

### Why It Works
[Brief explanation of how showing achieves what telling couldn't]
```

## Common Conversions

| Telling | Showing Approach |
|---------|------------------|
| "She was sad" | What she does, how she moves, what she avoids |
| "The party was fun" | A specific moment, a line of dialogue, a vivid detail |
| "He was unreliable" | Scene where he fails to show up, with consequences |
| "It was cold" | Breath visible, fingers stiff, specific temperature detail |
| "She was beautiful" | Specific details, how others react to her, what stands out |
| "The meal was delicious" | Specific flavors, textures, the cook's technique |
| "He was lying" | Microexpressions, word choices, what doesn't add up |

---

## Constraints

- Showing takes more words - that's the tradeoff for engagement
- Not everything needs to be shown - save it for what matters
- Don't over-explain the scene - trust the reader
- Keep the same meaning - showing a different thing is not conversion
- Maintain the author's voice - this is translation, not replacement

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "The startup was clearly failing. Everyone was stressed and the CEO was in denial. The board meeting that followed was uncomfortable."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Show Don't Tell Conversion

### Original (Telling)
"The startup was clearly failing. Everyone was stressed and the CEO was in denial. The board meeting that followed was uncomfortable."

### What It's Trying to Convey
A company in crisis, leadership disconnect, and organizational tension

### Showing Method Used
Scene with dialogue, action, and specific detail

### Converted (Showing)
The ping-pong table gathered dust. Three months since anyone had played.

At 9 AM sharp, the board filed in. They sat on one side of the table. Nobody touched the coffee.

"Revenue is tracking exactly to plan," Marcus said, advancing his slide. A chart appeared: a line climbing steadily upward.

Fiona, the CFO, looked at her hands.

"And retention?" Victoria asked. She was the only board member writing nothing down.

"Retention is—" Marcus clicked. Nothing happened. He clicked again. "The next slide shows—"

"Twenty-three percent," Fiona said. "Retention is at twenty-three percent."

The room went quiet. On the wall behind Marcus, the optimistic line continued its climb toward the ceiling.

### Why It Works
- "Clearly failing" → dusty ping-pong table, 23% retention, Fiona looking at hands
- "Everyone was stressed" → no one touches coffee, CFO's body language
- "CEO was in denial" → chart that contradicts reality, technical "difficulties"
- "Uncomfortable" → board member writing nothing, silence after the number
- The optimistic chart on the wall while the company burns is the final ironic detail

The reader experiences the failure and denial rather than being told about it.

## Twain's Maxims for This Skill

- "Don't say the old lady screamed. Bring her on and let her scream."
- "The author shall make the reader feel a deep interest in the personages of his tale and in their fate."
- A tale must accomplish something and arrive somewhere - and the reader must EXPERIENCE the journey.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Mark Twain** expert persona. Use it when writing feels flat, when you want readers to experience rather than observe, or when you need to make abstract concepts tangible and memorable.
